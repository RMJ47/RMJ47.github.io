            <p>This website is great because it follows<br> the rule of 
               thirds by using images and a layout that <br> meets all of
               the standard of an image. By using <br> the nine equal
               parts of an image and aligning the <br> image with these 
               points creates more tension,energy and <br> interest in 
               the composition <br> than simply centering the subject.

          <img src="/lesson2/images/" alt="VisualHierarchy">
          <p>This is an good example of Visual hierarchy <br> because it 
            shows the order that the human eye sees <br> the object. When 
            looking at the pictures you see a <br> large dog with other
            animals of different shapes,size and <br> color. Since the
            birds has the most color it is most<br> likely to be seen 
            first by the human eye first.</p>

          <p>This website has alot of pictures <b>that shows contrast 
             because it has a lot of different colors,<br> different 
             texture and different <br> objects together. It has 
             different items <br> to show opposing elements and it 
             shows the differs between<br> light and dark.</p>
