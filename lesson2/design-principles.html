            <p>This website is great because it follows the rule of <br> thirds by 
                using images and a layout that <br> meets all of the standard of
                an image. By using the nine equal<br> parts of an image and 
                aligning the image with these points<br> creates more tension,
                energy and interest in the composition<br> than simply centering 
                the subject.

          <img src="/lesson2/images/" alt="VisualHierarchy">
          <p>This is an good example of Visual hierarchy because it <br>shows the
             order that the human eye sees the object.<br> When looking at the 
             pictures you see a large dog with other <br> animals of different 
             shapes,size and color. Since the birds has the <br> most color it
             is most likely to be seen first<b> by the human eye first.</p>

          <p>This website has alot of pictures <b>that shows contrast because it 
            has a lot of different colors,<br> different texture and different
            objects together. It has different items <br> to show opposing elements
            and it shows the differs between<br> light and dark.</p>
